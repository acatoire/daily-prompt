# Readme Language and Vocabulary Check

This prompt helps ensure your README files are clear, consistent, and use appropriate language and terminology.  
It is especially useful in a multicultural company, where team members may have different native languages and cultural backgrounds, to promote understanding and inclusivity.

**We recommend using English (USA) as the common language for all documentation and communication.**
