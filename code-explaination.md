test("Delete a non existing item", async () => {
const fakeItemd = "0123456789";
const resultDelete = await agent.delete(Endpoints.ITEMS.itemsById(fakeDataProductId));
expect(resultDelete).toHaveStatus(404);
expect(resultDelete.body).toHaveValidSchema(getFilePath(RESOURCES_SCHEMAS_PATH, "ErrorResponse.json"));
expect(resultDelete.body.errors[0].detail).toEqual(
No record of Item could be found with id ${fakeItemId}.,
);
});
```

Result:
```markdown
This test checks what happens when you try to delete an item that does not exist.

Here’s what each step does:

Creates a fake item ID ("0123456789") that is not in the database.
Sends a DELETE request to the API to try to delete the item with this fake ID.
Checks that the API returns a 404 status code, which means "Not Found". This is the correct response when the item does not exist.
Checks that the error message format is correct by comparing it to the expected error schema.
Checks that the error message says there is no item with the given ID.
This test makes sure the API responds correctly and clearly when someone tries to delete an item that isn’t there.

test("Delete a non existing item", async () => {
const fakeItemd = "0123456789";
const resultDelete = await agent.delete(Endpoints.ITEMS.itemsById(fakeDataProductId));
expect(resultDelete).toHaveStatus(404);

No record of Item could be found with id ${fakeItemId}.,
);
});
```

Result:
```markdown
This test verifies the API's behavior when attempting to delete an item that does not exist in the system. As a senior QA, you’ll recognize this as a negative test case designed to ensure robust error handling and clear communication to API consumers.

Step-by-step explanation:

Setup:
A fake item ID ("0123456789") is defined, which is guaranteed not to exist in the database.

Action:
The test sends a DELETE request to the endpoint responsible for deleting items, using the fake ID.

Validation:

It asserts that the response status is 404 Not Found, confirming the API correctly identifies the absence of the resource.
It checks that the response body matches the expected error schema (ErrorResponse.json), ensuring consistency in error reporting.
It verifies the error message detail explicitly states that no item was found with the provided ID, which is important for transparency and troubleshooting.
Why this matters:
This test ensures the API gracefully handles invalid delete operations, returns meaningful error information, and adheres to contract (status code and schema). This is critical for downstream consumers and for maintaining predictable, reliable API behavior in production.
