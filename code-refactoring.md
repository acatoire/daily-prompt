## Example
```markdown
You are an AI assistant specialized in software development and code quality.
Your task is to refactor the provided code by renaming variables to improve clarity and checking if names are correct.

Here is the code:
---
def calc(a, b):
    c = a + b
    return c
---

Please refactor variable names and explain your changes.
```

Result:
```python
# Refactored variable names for clarity:
def add_numbers(first_number, second_number):
    result = first_number + second_number
    return result

# Explanation:
# - Renamed 'calc' to 'add_numbers' to clarify the function's purpose.
# - Renamed 'a' and 'b' to 'first_number' and 'second_number' for readability.
# - Renamed 'c' to 'result' to reflect its role.
```
